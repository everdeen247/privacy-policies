Privacy Policy

This Santa AI Camera app (the "Service") is provided by Tim L (the "Developer" or "I").

This page is used to inform users (you) regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. If you disagree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you may choose not to use the Service.

1. Information Collection and Use

1.1 Direct Personal Information Collection by the App
The Santa AI Camera app does not directly collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from users, such as name, email address, address, or payment information, for the purpose of using the Service. This Service does not have login or payment functionality.

1.2 Camera and Storage Access Permissions
My Service requests specific permissions to your device for the purpose of photo capture and saving.
Camera Permission: This permission is used solely for the core function of the app, which is taking photos. I do not collect or transmit any image or video data captured through this function to any external server.
Storage Permission: This permission is used solely to save the photos you take locally onto your device (phone). I do not access any other files within your device storage.
If you refuse these permissions, you may still be able to use the app, but the photo capture and saving features may not function.

1.3 Service Providers (Third-Party Services)
The Service uses third-party services ("Service Providers") that may collect and use information to provide and improve the functionality of the app. These Service Providers may collect information that could be used to identify you.

Google AdMob (Advertising):
I use Google AdMob to serve advertisements in order to keep the Service free. AdMob collects and uses information about your device and your use of the Service to serve personalized ads. This information may include your device identifier, IP address, device type and model, and service usage information.
For more information regarding the data collection and use by Google AdMob, please refer to the Google policies below:

2. Log Data
Whenever you use my Service and an error occurs (including through the use of third-party services), I collect data called Log Data on your device. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This information is used solely for diagnosing errors and improving the Service.

3. Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. My Service does not use "cookies" directly, but the third-party service providers (e.g., Google AdMob) I use may utilize them to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device through your device settings.

4. Security
I value your trust in providing your information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

5. Children's Privacy (COPPA)
My Service is intended for all age groups without restriction.
I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If I become aware that a child has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete this from the servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me immediately at aigamiraeda@gmail.com so that I can take necessary actions.

Third-party services (AdMob) are set to provide restricted advertising for children, subject to their own policies and legal requirements.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of December 5, 2025.
